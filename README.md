# Executive Briefing: Hotel Operations Overview (2021–2023)

## Project Background

Solara Haven Group operates two distinct hotel properties: **MidTown Luxury Hotel** and **4 Star Resort & Hotel**. The company collects substantial data on revenue, bookings, guest behavior, and operational metrics, but much of this information had remained under-leveraged. This briefing synthesizes and analyzes this data to uncover insights that drive operational improvements, revenue growth, and guest experience enhancement.

Insights and recommendations are provided across the following strategic areas:

* **Revenue Trends:** Analysis of historical revenue changes and growth performance.
* **Parking Demand:** Evaluation of parking request volume over time and by hotel type.
* **Seasonality Analysis:** Review of ADR and guest night fluctuations across seasonal cycles.
* **Hotel Performance Comparison:** Comparative performance assessment between the two properties.

## Business Context & Data Overview

Solara Haven Group’s hotel revenue grew from $5.74M in 2021 to $20.95M in 2022, marking a 265.1% year-over-year increase, followed by a decline to $11.54M in 2023 (–44.9% YoY). Despite the drop, 2023 revenue remained 101.1% higher than in 2021. The sharp rise in 2022 reflects post pandemic recovery, while 2023 suggests market stabilization. MidTown Luxury Hotel led performance with 57.4% of total revenue ($21.44M).

The dataset reveals several key metrics that highlight the scale of operations across the hotel properties analyzed. Over the span of the data collected:

Total Revenue amounted to **$37.34 million**, reflecting the strong financial performance of the hotels during the observed period.

Total Guest Nights reached **485,890**, indicating high occupancy and sustained guest engagement across both properties.

Total Requested Parking Spaces totaled **8,819**, offering insight into guest preferences and potential facility demand for parking accommodations.

These figures serve as foundational indicators of overall business activity and help contextualize deeper analyses into revenue trends, guest behavior, and operational needs.
The analysis supports operational, pricing, and marketing decisions by focusing on performance fluctuations, customer demand trends, and infrastructure needs.


## Summary of Key Insights

### 1. Revenue Growth Trends

* 2022 revenue reached \$20.95M, a 265.1% increase from 2021’s \$5.74M.
* 2023 revenue fell to \$11.54M, but was still 101.1% higher than 2021.
* MidTown Luxury Hotel was the top contributor, generating \$21.44M (57.4% of total).
* Revenue trends indicate a sharp recovery in 2022, followed by a moderate decline that remained well above 2021 levels.

### 2. Parking Demand Analysis

* Parking requests increased from 1,303 in 2021 to 5,238 in 2022 (+301.8%).
* Demand dropped to 2,278 in 2023, but remained 74.8% higher than in 2021.
* 4 Star Resort accounted for \~73% of 2022 parking requests.
* Parking demand patterns align with peak guest seasons and may indicate increased infrastructure usage during high-traffic months.

### 3. Seasonal Trends in ADR & Guest Volume

* Average ADR across all data was \$99.42.
* ADR peaked above \$150 consistently in July and December.
* Guest volume increased during these same periods, supporting revenue surges.
* The pattern confirms strong seasonality in pricing and demand behavior.

| Peak Months | Typical ADR | Guest Volume  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| July        | \$150+      | High bookings |
| December    | \$150+      | Holiday spike |

### 4. Property Comparison

* MidTown Luxury Hotel earned \$21.44M (57.4% of total revenue).
* 4 Star Resort & Hotel earned \$15.91M (42.6%), but drove more parking and seasonal demand.
* MidTown led in total annual revenue each year, while the Resort showed greater fluctuation in parking and seasonal demand.
* Operational needs differ: Resort needs infrastructure support; MidTown maintained leadership in total annual revenue.

### 5. Additional Operational Insight: Booking Cancellations

* Although not originally requested by stakeholders, a review of cancellation data revealed important behavioral trends across both properties.
* Cancellation rates declined consistently from 2021 to 2023.
* 2021 had the highest cancellation ratio relative to total bookings, potentially reflecting pandemic-related uncertainty.
* 2022 and 2023 showed marked improvements, which may indicate stronger guest confidence, better communication, or revised booking policies.
* These patterns suggest that the organization has already made progress in improving booking reliability. However, further analysis—such as identifying high-risk booking segments or understanding common cancellation triggers—could unlock opportunities for revenue recovery and targeted guest engagement strategies.



## Strategic Recommendations

**Invest in Parking Expansion** at the 4 Star Resort, which saw a 300%+ increase in demand during peak years.
**Leverage Seasonal ADR Increases**: Maintain or enhance pricing strategies in July and December when both ADR and volume spike.
**Assess Revenue Dip in 2023**: Explore potential causes of the 2023 revenue dip—such as seasonal patterns or changes in demand—through further analysis of operational and marketing data.
**Segment Operational Strategy**: Differentiate approaches between MidTown Luxury Hotel and the 4 Star Resort & Hotel—e.g., focus MidTown on consistent revenue and the Resort on managing seasonality and amenities.


## Considerations & Caveats

Data before 2021 was excluded due to low volume or incomplete reporting.
Parking data was analyzed from complete, non-null records only.
ADR values were accepted as aggregated due to reporting constraints in Power BI.
Guest night trends were calculated from weekday + weekend stay fields.
